            <h1>Ashley's Trip to Italy</h1>


            <p>When I think about traveling abroad, I think about the auspicious book by Dr. Seuss, <u>Oh, the Places You'll Go!</u> I came upon this book in search of scholarships in my high school senior year.</p>

            <p class="quotes">&#34Today is the day&#34</p>

            <p>I came upon an opportunity for an educational experience to go to Italy with a High School program. I applied, asked about how I could raise the money, made a gofundme account, and asked everyone I could. I worked; I was working $200 a month, but at the end of the day, I was not able travel to Italy at that time.</p>

            <p class="quotes">
                &#34Just never forget to be dexterous and deft&#34
                <br>
                <br>
                &#34And never mix up your right foot with your left&#34
            </p>

            <p>When it came time to choose a college, I knew I had to go to college outside of Boston. For some reason I chose Syracuse University, and although the reason for deciding Syracuse is a little peculiar, I was on the five-hour car ride to a place that made sense at the time.</p>

            <p class="quotes">&#34You're off to Great Places! You're off and away!&#34</p>

            <p>Something led me to SU, and so, I chose to explore the city, sees its city folk, walking both affluent and disenfranchised streets. I know my place was to venture outside the university bubble, and interact with the palpable world with genuine highlights and problems, and appreciate it in a social and cultural exchange.</p>

            <p class="quotes">
                &#34You have brains in your head&#34
                <br>
                <br>
                &#34You have feet in your shoes&#34
            </p>

            <p>â€¦And a mouth to explore food. I like food. Therefore, when I realized that I could make it my prerogative to study food, I hopped on the wagon and decided to major in Nutrition Science and connect it the rest of my interests.</p>

            <p class="quotes">
                &#34You will not lag behind, because you'll have the speed&#34
                <br>
                <br>
                &#34You'll pass the whole gang and you'll soon take the lead&#34
            </p>

            <p>In high school, I had an inclination that I would someday go to Italy because of my love for food, and so something about the portrayal of Italian food and culture was leading me there. I need to go there to explore the cultural institutions that go beyond the production and consumption of food, and every landscape that it covers within the culture. Therefore, I applied to an abroad program that would fulfill my long desired dream. I decided not to let any doubt get in my way. I remember before deciding to come to Syracuse saying, that I will find a way to get to Italy from there.</p>

            <p class="quotes">
                &#34You can steer yourself&#34
                <br>
                <br>
                &#34Any direction you choose&#34
            </p>

            <p>Having an immersive experience in Italy would expand my linguistics by further deepen my understanding of the romance language. In high school, I had to learn Latin, and Roman history, and I believe in historical tourism as a culturally appreciative and preservative method for solidarity on global scale, and the global economy. This is why I have decided to apply to SU abroad summer program Florence Summer Session. This program is a six-week program that explores Florence and Tuscany through the lens art, economics, the global context and history and culture. This program will provide me with an internship that will provide me with necessary tools for global context through the cultural lens of Italy, in addition to further offset the cultural bias that has been presented to me in order to societal norms.</p>

            <p class="quotes">
                &#34You're on your own. And you know what you know&#34
                <br>
                <br>
                &#34And YOU are the guy who'll decide where to go&#34
            </p>

            <p>In addition, this study abroad experience will count as a cultural immersion that is required in my college as part of my program, and will further my pursuits in nutrition dietetics. Distinctive parts of this program that I look forward is living with a host family, as it will give me a firsthand experience with a type of family dynamic within the Italian culture. I am also interested in the historical course work, as it will give me a firsthand perspective of Italian history and culture. Lastly, I am excited for the internship experience that will give me experience credit, immerse me in the language and obtain work experience.</p>

            <p class="quotes">
                &#34Wherever you fly, you'll be the best of the best&#34
                <br>
                <br>
                &#34Wherever you go, you will top all the rest&#34
            </p>

            <p>I am overjoyed at the thought of finally being able to experience travel in the type of immersive experience that only studying abroad can provide. The challenges that I will face is trying to raise the funds for this trip, as my mom is a single parent and does not have a stable income. Also with the rise cost of expenses in Boston, it is becoming harder for the working class to make ends-meat. I am also worried about not being a traditional student, I typically think outside the box, and I am willing to explore where life takes me. Although my concerns are legitimate, I am determined to gain everything I possibly can from this experience.</p>

                &#34And will you succeed?&#34
                <br>
                <br>
                &#34Yes! You will, indeed!&#34
